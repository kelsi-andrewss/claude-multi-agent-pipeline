description: Open the charts dashboard and today's key-prompts file for the current project. Use when the user says "open charts", "view tracking", "show dashboard", or "/view-tracking".

Open the tracking dashboard for the current project.

Steps:

1. Set the tracking directory: `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/`

2. Open the charts dashboard:
   ```bash
   open "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/charts.html"
   ```
   If the file doesn't exist, report: "No charts.html found at $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/charts.html"

3. Find and open today's key-prompts file. Today's date is available from the system. The file path is:
   `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/key-prompts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using today's date)

   - If it exists: `open "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/key-prompts/YYYY-MM-DD.md"`
   - If it doesn't exist: report "No key-prompts file for today yet." then list the most recent file in that directory:
     ```bash
     ls -t "$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/key-prompts/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1
     ```
     If a recent file exists, offer: "Most recent: <filename>" and ask if the user wants to open it.

4. If the entire `.claude/tracking/` directory doesn't exist, report: "No tracking directory found for this project. Expected: $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/.claude/tracking/"

Run the bash commands using the Bash tool. Do not ask for confirmation before opening files.
